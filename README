----------
logParse.c      - source code
.git/           - git Repository***(I am unsure on how i should handle this? should it be submitted?)
Makefile        - makefile

3-COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------
Usage: ./logParse [-h] [-i] [dirname ][-o] [dirname]
-h,   --help                    Print a help message and exit
-i,   --input file              Include input file name
-o,   --ouput file              Include output file name
-t n  --timer                   user set timer for program termination using integer n representing seconds
input file is format is:
n               were n is a single integer represnting the number of lines that will be processed as children
x a b c d       each line is then proccsed by forking a child to solve subsetsum problem with x being the sum
default settings: -i input.dat -o output.dat -t 60

4-CODE COMPILATION:
---------
In my computer I am able to run the make file an execute with ./logParse
example:
>make
>./logParse -i [dirname.dat] -o [dirname.dat]

5-DESIGN DECISIONS & ISSUES
---------
Design Decisions:
I required the output file to exist, it handle invalid output files being produced.
Major Issues:

Minor Issues:
1) (possibly resolved)too large of inputs while checking for child processes termination, will result in an integer overflow,
 that tricks the algo into think it has succedded and outputs a garbage result to output.dat file.
        - currently unable to reproduce the above.
2) in the output file, my current solution to the subsetsum problem insists on saving a 0 in the first index of the first solution.
